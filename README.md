Potluck Planner allows users to keep track of events they are invited to, reply their attendance, and comment what they will be bringing. They can sort through their events by date or category, and add items to their shopping list. Users can create their own events and let their invitees know details of the invent and add food suggestions.

# Technologies

This project's frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The backend was created using Active Record and a Sinatra based backend, which can be found here: https://github.com/opomeroy26/phase-3-sinatra-react-project

# Launch
To launch the frontend:
`npm install`
`npm start`

To launch the backend:
`bundle install`
`rake db:migrate`
`rake db:seed`
`bundle exec rake server`

Frontend: Navigate to `localhost:3000/`
Backend: Navigate to `localhost:9292/events`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
